# boilerplate

_boilerplate_ is my personal starting point for new projects. It could probably be a little less bloated but, screw you, it&rsquo;s my boilerplate I can include what I like!

It includes some basic markup, a solid starting directory structure and some popular dependencies like: a [Google Font](https://www.google.com/fonts),  [Normalize](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/), [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) and [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/).

Feel free to use any code from _boilerplate_ in your own projects; it&rsquo;s probably mostly stolen from other sources anyway.
