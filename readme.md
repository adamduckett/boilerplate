# cola

_cola_ is my personal starting point for new projects. It features everything [cola-diet](https://github.com/adamduckett/cola-diet.git) does with a little extra sugar (namely: jQuery, Google Fonts and Modernizr).

Looking for the diet option? Grab [cola-diet](https://github.com/adamduckett/cola-diet.git) instead.

Feel free to use any code from _cola_ in your own projects; we're all friends here, mate!
